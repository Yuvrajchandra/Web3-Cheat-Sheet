Solidity is an object-oriented, high-level language for implementing smart contracts. 
### What are Smart Contracts?
Smart contracts are digital contracts stored on a blockchain that are automatically executed when predetermined terms and conditions are met.

Solidity's code is encapsulated in contracts. A contract is the fundamental building block of Ethereum applications â€” all variables and functions belong to a contract, and this will be the starting point of all your projects. An empty contract named HelloWorld would look like this:
```
contract HelloWorld {

}
